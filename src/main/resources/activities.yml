# Definitions of activities for the PSIP automation site.
# 
# Activity: An activity is a top level menu on the site nav bar that is displayed using the 'name' and 'icon' elements.
#           The page will display the 'description' along with a summary of each of the categories (see below) using
#           a progress bar element that indicates how close to completion the activity is. The pages can be directly
#           accessed using the 'path' element. Scores define the scores being used for assessment.
